Manual
======

This product will add a `permalink`__ to every Plone content, using the Plone *resolveuid* feature.

__ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink

This will not work (and show anything) for contents without the *UID* information. The new resource will
be added to the *document actions* section.
